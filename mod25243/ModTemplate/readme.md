Copy `mod25243` folder into `Documents\my games\Stationeers\mods`.
The `Documents` folder is usually located under `%USERPROFILE%`. Check via Explorer to make sure.

Don't name mod folder with `-Debug` postfix. Stationeers.Addons handle loading of such mods differently and requires debug DLL for it.
